Hey claude I have built many full stack applications and after doing that with AI I have realised that AI can give you insane output but you just need to have domain knowledge and instruct it in such a way to build it so basically the output is same as your knowledge and your ability to explain it, plan, fix the errors so right now what I want to do is after bouncing back with so many errors I have built two complex full stack application but after reading about antropic agent harness which can build full stack applications end to end I want to build such a harness that I can use with antigravity google agentic ide so this is my goal I my aim is that any ai can give you basic frontend shit but you have to give very very good instructions to get the best color theme, micro interactions, elements, functionality, best design choices, orientations and all the important hings like responsisvenes, how to structure the state etc, how to make such that api integration becomes easy, make it scalable, optimization etc most importantly for frontend, there similar for backend that I want it have scalable, good and proper code, good folder structure, security, authentication, rate limiting, error handling, best database design, database optimizations, query optimizations, decision choices, designing of system, observability,caching. Ratelimiting etc I am not able to tell all those but I want you search and find all the things that should be present in the full stack web application to make it really production level code, ready to deploy, containerisation, migrations etc and all the best things so basically I want a professional software engineers team and it should have an entire sslc team of 100s of engineers I think you know sslc so basically if not search for sslc and need to have all those sdlc teams should work but here they ai agents will become sdlc and now your role is to figure out effectively orchestrated those agent and one with the best knowledge should orchestrated all the agents and each one should be able discuss with each other and can even ask me for feedback so basically what I want is that I will give some ideas or should validate, design features, ask me questions, analyze market for, and everything like sdlc teams and give beat output with everything tested 
I want to make such harness help me do it so basically it should give production ready, scalable and perfect code, I should not go back and forth to fix the errors 
But rhai is very very important most of the time ai will give bad ui/ux I don't know how you do it I want the best output for this no need to consider tokens 
You mention explicitly and force the agents that tokens are not the issue you can use any number of tokens but priority is very very good output and perfect code and you can even break a task into parts of needed but no compromise in quality should look like it is shipped by group of engineers and also keep a log of progress and make a proper comoit messages and push to GitHub
What you have given is great but just like I have mentioned from frontend there will so many other things which I have forgot to mention and there will so many things which a production level engineer who has built scalable systems for thousands of people will have knowledge of I want you include all those because knowledge,planning and the way we instruct changes the quality of the output whether we get shit output or very good output so I want all the very very deep domain knowledge of a engineer who has built million dollar apps for each section agent we should provide that knowledge explicitly because we should give knowledge and enforce that standard not just some basic vibe coding stuff
What you have given is good about the agent distribution but I think you can still improve in the distribution and sdlc 
The agents should first ask me in such a way that even any person can answer and also help me decide tech stack 
I want you improve this overall and we are competing with companies like Google we want similar output and ship sass application even very complex with no issue in short time but quality is most important and I don't want ai output where the design,code or some other things are inconsistent and there are some buttons they don't work etc there should be perfect sync between frotend and backend and overall app they should happen perfectly
Give me improved plan I want best output
